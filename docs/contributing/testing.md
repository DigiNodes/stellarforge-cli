# Testing Guidelines

StellarForge CLI uses Vitest for its automated TypeScript test suite. Tests should be deterministic, isolated, and safe to run from a clean checkout or CI environment.

## Test Categories

### Unit tests

Use unit tests for pure functions, error mapping, parsers, validation, and other logic that does not need a real process or filesystem boundary.

Keep unit tests close to the behavior they exercise and inject collaborators where practical instead of mutating global process state.

### Integration tests

Use integration tests when behavior depends on a compiled CLI artifact, filesystem effects, or a child process boundary.

The existing executable suite is the reference pattern for testing the built `dist/cli.js` artifact.

## Shared Helpers

Reusable test infrastructure lives under `tests/helpers/`.

- `temp-directory.ts` creates unique OS temp directories and provides deterministic cleanup, including cleanup when an action throws.
- `captured-output.ts` creates an injected `TerminalOutput` with in-memory stdout/stderr capture without replacing global process streams.
- `cli-process.ts` builds and invokes the compiled CLI using argument arrays with `shell: false`.

Prefer these helpers over duplicating fixture setup in individual test files.

## Filesystem Isolation

Tests that write files should use `createTempDirectoryFixture()` or `withTempDirectory()` instead of repository paths, user home directories, or shared static temp paths.

Every fixture must be cleaned deterministically. `withTempDirectory()` is preferred when cleanup should be guaranteed through a `finally` boundary.

## Process Tests

Use `runBuiltCli()` for compiled executable behavior. Do not construct shell command strings from test input.

Process tests should assert the relevant combination of:

- exit status;
- stdout;
- stderr;
- filesystem effects, when applicable.

## Network Policy

The default test suite must not require live network access. Tests should not contact Stellar RPC, Horizon, npm registries, GitHub, or other remote services unless a future explicitly separated integration-test policy authorizes it.

Network-facing code should be tested through injected or controlled boundaries whenever possible.

## Running Tests

From a clean checkout:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
```

Before opening a pull request, run the full local validation set documented in the installation and contribution guides.
