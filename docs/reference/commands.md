## Global command behavior

### Help

```bash
stellarforge --help
stellarforge new --help
```

Help exits successfully with code `0`.

### Version

```bash
stellarforge --version
```

The version comes from installed package metadata. No registry request or subprocess is used.

Unknown commands, unknown options, and missing required positional arguments are usage failures and exit with code `2`.

## `stellarforge new <project-name>`

Creates a new project from a bundled, project-controlled template.

### Usage

```bash
stellarforge new <project-name> [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-t, --template <id>` | Select a bundled template. |

Supported template IDs are:

- `basic-app` — default when `--template` is omitted;
- `full-stack`;
- `smart-contract`;
- `api-service`.

### Examples

```bash
stellarforge new my-app
stellarforge new payments-api --template api-service
stellarforge new escrow-contract -t smart-contract
```

Generation validates project names and destinations before writing. Existing non-empty destinations are not overwritten. Templates come only from the bundled template registry; arbitrary URLs, filesystem template paths, or executable template code are not accepted.

See [Template Generation Safety](template-generation.md).

### Common failures

- invalid or missing project name;
- unsupported template ID;
- destination traversal or invalid destination;
- existing non-empty destination;
- invalid bundled template content.

These are validation failures and exit with code `2`.

## `stellarforge doctor`

Runs the registered development-environment diagnostics.

### Usage

```bash
stellarforge doctor
```

The current diagnostic set checks the supported Node.js/npm runtime and relevant local development tools, including Git, Rust, Cargo, Stellar CLI, and Docker.

The report renders each result, remediation guidance when available, a summary, and an overall health result.

### Exit behavior

- `0` — no required diagnostic failed;
- `5` — one or more required diagnostics failed.

Warnings do not by themselves make the command fail.

The command does not print complete sensitive environment values.

## `stellarforge dev`

Starts the supported local-development workflow for a generated Node.js StellarForge project.

### Usage

```bash
cd my-project
stellarforge dev
```

The command requires a valid project `package.json` with a `scripts` object. Script selection uses the first supported entry in this order:

1. `dev`;
2. `start`;
3. `start:backend`.

StellarForge invokes npm as an executable with an argument array; it does not execute the package script text through a constructed shell command.

Child stdout/stderr are streamed with process labels.

### Common failures

- no `package.json`;
- invalid JSON;
- missing `scripts` object;
- no supported development script;
- child process startup or runtime failure.

Validation failures use code `2`; failed child processes use code `3`.

## `stellarforge test`

Runs the supported project test workflow.

### Usage

```bash
cd my-project
stellarforge test
```

Supported project forms are:

- Node.js project with a `package.json` `test` script → `npm run test`;
- Cargo workspace/project with `Cargo.toml` → `cargo test`.

When both are present, the Node.js project test workflow is selected first.

StellarForge does not execute package script text directly. It delegates through npm or Cargo and preserves external-process failures.

### Exit behavior

- `0` — test workflow completed successfully;
- `2` — project/test configuration is unsupported or invalid;
- `3` — the test subprocess fails.

## `stellarforge deploy`

Deploys a supported smart-contract Cargo project to **Stellar Testnet**.

### Usage

Using explicit CLI options:

```bash
stellarforge deploy --network testnet --source deployer
```

Using project configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "network": "testnet",
  "identity": "deployer"
}
```

```bash
stellarforge deploy
```

CLI values override corresponding values from `stellarforge.config.json`:

```bash
stellarforge deploy --source release-deployer
```

### Options

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--network <network>` | Explicit deployment network. CLI value overrides project configuration. |
| `--source <identity>` | Named Stellar CLI identity alias. CLI value overrides project configuration. |

The effective network and identity must both be present after configuration resolution.

The MVP deployment command accepts only the exact network value `testnet`. A project config value of `mainnet` or `futurenet` is valid schema data for future command use, but it is rejected by the deploy command.

The source must be a named Stellar CLI identity. Raw secret keys, seed phrases, account/public StrKeys, and path-like values are rejected.

The invoked external command is equivalent to:

```text
stellar contract deploy --source-account deployer --network testnet
```

No shell interpolation is used. Signing material remains under Stellar CLI identity management.

### Exit behavior

- `0` — deployment subprocess completes successfully;
- `2` — configuration, project layout, network, or identity input is invalid;
- `3` — Stellar CLI fails to start or returns a failure.

See [Configuration](configuration.md) and [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

## Unsupported or planned behavior

The following are not part of the implemented MVP command surface:

- Mainnet deployment;
- Futurenet or local-network deployment through `stellarforge deploy`;
- `stellarforge add`;
- plugin execution;
- remote template registries;
- arbitrary/executable project configuration;
- raw-key deployment arguments;
- automatic fallback to Mainnet;
- arbitrary custom deployment commands.

Do not rely on roadmap items as available behavior until their implementation is merged and documented.
