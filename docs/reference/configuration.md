# Configuration Reference

StellarForge uses an optional project-root configuration file named `stellarforge.config.json`.

## MVP schema

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "network": "testnet",
  "identity": "deployer"
}
```

`version` is required and must currently be `1`.

`network` is optional and accepts `testnet`, `futurenet`, or `mainnet`. A configured network does not bypass command-specific restrictions: the MVP deploy command still permits Testnet only.

`identity` is optional and must be the name of an identity already managed by Stellar CLI. StellarForge does not accept raw secret keys, seed phrases, public StrKeys, filesystem paths, tokens, or password-like fields in project configuration.

## Precedence

Where a command exposes a CLI override, the order is:

1. explicit CLI option;
2. project configuration;
3. missing.

StellarForge does not silently default a missing network to Mainnet or any other network.

For example:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "network": "testnet",
  "identity": "team-deployer"
}
```

allows:

```bash
stellarforge deploy
```

to use those project settings, while:

```bash
stellarforge deploy --source release-deployer
```

overrides only the identity.

## Loading and validation

The file must:

- live at the project root;
- be a regular file rather than a symbolic link;
- be no larger than 64 KiB;
- contain valid JSON;
- contain only supported schema fields.

Validation failures are designed to be actionable without echoing raw file contents or sensitive values.
